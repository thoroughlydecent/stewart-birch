<p>Throughout my career in Development, a constant has been a desire to breakdown the barriers between departments and disciplines that so many company find themselves creating (albeit unwittingly). True success can only be achieved by tapping the collective knowledge and experiences of the larger team and the value they can give to a project. A workflow based on collaboration must be encouraged to avoid the mistakes of the past and to achieve that, all parties have to be open and transparent with their colleagues, agency glasnost if you will.</p>
<p>I’ve recruited and managed Developers of many shapes and disciplines, skill levels and languages producing projects on multiple platforms and a host of different content management systems. An ambition of mine is to create multi-disciplined teams that can work together to tackle the toughest of briefs and create innovative solutions and products.</p>
<p>At time of writing I am very interested in the preprocessing tools such as SASS to give Developers scope to produce efficient, maintainable and extensible code. Mobile first is regarded as best practice and modular patterns using a preprocessor are very exciting and certainly something I want to utilise wherever I can.</p>

At anyone time I could be managing projects intended to work on 5 different environments or systems, in addition to this Addison had a strong prescence in continental Europe and sites would often be multilingual (as many as five languages) so there was a lot to keep my eye on. To hit the vary agressive deadlines, I also managed up to 15 Developers and QA Testers with with Developers working on a shift basis.</p>
